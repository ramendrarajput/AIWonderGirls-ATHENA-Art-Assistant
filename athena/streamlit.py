                1874 - December 7, 1970) was an American painter who worked mostly in Paris and Capri. 
                She specialized in portraiture and used a subdued tonal palette keyed to the color gray. 
                Brooks ignored contemporary artistic trends such as Cubism and Fauvism, drawing on her own original aesthetic inspired by the 
                works of Charles Conder, Walter Sickert, and James McNeill Whistler. Her subjects ranged from anonymous models to titled aristocrats. 
                She is best known for her images of women in androgynous or masculine dress, including her self-portrait of 1923, 
                which is her most widely reproduced work. Brooks had an unhappy childhood after her alcoholic father abandoned the family; 
                her mother was emotionally abusive and her brother mentally ill. By her own account, her childhood cast a shadow over her whole life. 
                She spent several years in Italy and France as a poor art student, then inherited a fortune upon her mother's death in 1902. 
                Wealth gave her the freedom to choose her own subjects. She often painted people close to her, 
                such as the Italian writer and politician Gabriele D'Annunzio, the Russian dancer Ida Rubinstein, and her partner of 
                more than 50 years, the writer Natalie Barney. Although she lived until 1970, it is erroneously believed that she painted very 
                little after 1925 despite evidence to the contrary. She made a series of drawings during the 1930s, using an 
                *unpremeditated* techniques predating automatic drawing. She spent time in New York City in the mid 1930s, 
                completing portraits of Carl Van Vechten and Muriel Draper. Many of her works are unaccounted for, 
                but photographic reproductions attest to her ongoing artwork. 
                It is thought to have culminated in her 1961 portrait of Duke Uberto Strozzi. (*source: Wikipedia*)""")

                worked primarily in painting and printmaking, and also used pastel and made other works on paper. 
                She was an active participant in the New York School of artists in the 1950s. A native of Chicago, 
                she is associated with the American abstract expressionist movement, even though she lived in France for much of her career. 
                Mitchell's emotionally intense style and its gestural brushwork were influenced by nineteenth-century post-impressionist painters, 
                particularly Henri Matisse. Memories of landscapes inspired her compositions; she famously told art critic Irving Sandler, 
                "I carry my landscapes around with me." Her later work was informed and constrained by her declining health. 
                Mitchell was one of her era's few female painters to gain critical and public acclaim. Her paintings, drawings, 
                and editioned prints can be seen in major museums and collections around the world, and have sold for record-breaking prices. 
                In 2021, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and Baltimore Museum of Art co-organized a comprehensive retrospective of her work.
                In her will, Mitchell provided for the creation of the Joan Mitchell Foundation, a non-profit corporation that awards grants

                was an American modernist artist. She was known for her paintings of enlarged flowers, New York skyscrapers, 
                and New Mexico landscapes. O'Keeffe has been called the "Mother of American modernism". In 1905, O'Keeffe began art training 
                at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago[3] and then the Art Students League of New York. 
                In 1908, unable to fund further education, she worked for two years as a commercial illustrator and then taught in Virginia, 
                Texas, and South Carolina between 1911 and 1918. She studied art in the summers between 1912 and 1914 and was introduced 
                to the principles and philosophies of Arthur Wesley Dow, who created works of art based upon personal style, design, 
                and interpretation of subjects, rather than trying to copy or represent them. This caused a major change in the way 
                she felt about and approached art, as seen in the beginning stages of her watercolors from her studies at the 
                University of Virginia and more dramatically in the charcoal drawings that she produced in 1915 that led to total abstraction. 
                Alfred Stieglitz, an art dealer and photographer, held an exhibit of her works in 1917. Over the next couple of years, 
                she taught and continued her studies at the Teachers College, Columbia University. 
                She moved to New York in 1918 at Stieglitz's request and began working seriously as an artist. 
                They developed a professional and personal relationship that led to their marriage in 1924. 
                O'Keeffe created many forms of abstract art, including close-ups of flowers, such as the Red Canna paintings, 
                that many found to represent vulvas, though O'Keeffe consistently denied that intention. 
                The imputation of the depiction of women's sexuality was also fueled by explicit and sensuous photographs of 
                O'Keeffe that Stieglitz had taken and exhibited. O'Keeffe and Stieglitz lived together in New York until 1929, 
                when O'Keeffe began spending part of the year in the Southwest, which served as inspiration for her paintings of New Mexico 
                landscapes and images of animal skulls, such as Cow's Skull: Red, White, and Blue and Ram's Head White Hollyhock and Little Hills. 
                After Stieglitz's death, she lived in New Mexico at Georgia O'Keeffe Home and Studio in 
                AbiquiÃº until the last years of her life, when she lived in Santa Fe. In 2014, O'Keeffe's 1932 painting 
                Jimson Weed/White Flower No. 1 sold for $44,405,000, more than three times the previous world auction record for any female artist.
                After her death, the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum was established in Santa Fe. (*source: Wikipedia*)""")

        st.markdown("""[Betty Friedan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Friedan) (February 4, 1921 - February 4, 2006), was an American feminist writer 
        and activist. A leading figure in the women's movement in the United States, her 1963 book The Feminine Mystique is often credited with sparking 
        the second wave of American feminism in the 20th century. In 1966, Friedan co-founded and was elected the first president of the 
        National Organization for Women (NOW), which aimed to bring women "into the mainstream of American society now [in] fully equal partnership with men". 
        In 1970, after stepping down as NOW's first president, Friedan organized the nationwide Women's Strike for Equality on August 26, 
        the 50th anniversary of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution granting women the right to vote. The national 
        strike was successful beyond expectations in broadening the feminist movement; the march led by Friedan in New York City alone attracted 
        over 50,000 people. In 1971, Friedan joined other leading feminists to establish the National Women's Political Caucus. Friedan was 
        also a strong supporter of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution that passed the United States 
        House of Representatives (by a vote of 354-24) and Senate (84-8) following intense pressure by women's groups led by NOW in the early 1970s. 
        Following Congressional passage of the amendment, Friedan advocated for ratification of the amendment in the states and supported other 
        women's rights reforms: she founded the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws but was later critical of the abortion-centered 
        positions of many liberal feminists. Regarded as an influential author and intellectual in the United States, Friedan remained active in 
        politics and advocacy until the late 1990s, authoring six books. As early as the 1960s Friedan was critical of polarized and extreme 
        factions of feminism that attacked groups such as men and homemakers. One of her later books, The Second Stage (1981), critiqued what 
        Friedan saw as the extremist excesses of some feminists.""")

        st.markdown('>*"There is no gate no lock no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of my mind together."* - Virginia Woolf')
        st.markdown("""[Virginia Woolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Woolf) (25 January 1882 - 28 March 1941) was an English writer, 
        considered one of the most important modernist 20th-century authors and a pioneer in the use of stream of consciousness as a narrative device. 
        Woolf was born into an affluent household in South Kensington, London, the seventh child of Julia Prinsep Jackson and Leslie Stephen in a 
        blended family of eight which included the modernist painter Vanessa Bell. She was home-schooled in English classics and Victorian 
        literature from a young age. From 1897 to 1901, she attended the Ladies' Department of King's College London, where she studied 
        classics and history and came into contact with early reformers of women's higher education and the women's rights movement. 
        Encouraged by her father, Woolf began writing professionally in 1900. After her father's death in 1904, the Stephen family moved 
        from Kensington to the more bohemian Bloomsbury, where, in conjunction with the brothers' intellectual friends, they formed the 
        artistic and literary Bloomsbury Group. In 1912, she married Leonard Woolf, and in 1917, the couple founded the Hogarth Press, 
        which published much of her work. They rented a home in Sussex and moved there permanently in 1940. 
        Woolf had romantic relationships with women, including Vita Sackville-West, who also published her books through Hogarth Press. 
        Both women's literature became inspired by their relationship, which lasted until Woolf's death. 
        During the inter-war period, Woolf was an important part of London's literary and artistic society. 
        In 1915, she had published her first novel, The Voyage Out, through her half-brother's publishing house, Gerald Duckworth and Company. 
        Her best-known works include the novels Mrs Dalloway (1925), To the Lighthouse (1927) and Orlando (1928). 
        She is also known for her essays, including A Room of One's Own (1929). 
        Woolf became one of the central subjects of the 1970s movement of feminist criticism and her works have since 
        attracted much attention and widespread commentary for "inspiring feminism". Her works have been translated into more than 50 languages. 
        A large body of literature is dedicated to her life and work, and she has been the subject of plays, novels and films. 
        Woolf is commemorated today by statues, societies dedicated to her work and a building at the University of London. 
        Throughout her life, Woolf was troubled by mental illness. She was institutionalised several times and attempted suicide 
        at least twice. According to Dalsimer (2004) her illness was characterised by symptoms that today would be diagnosed as 
        bipolar disorder, for which there was no effective intervention during her lifetime. 
        In 1941, at age 59, Woolf died by drowning herself in the River Ouse at Lewes.""")

        st.markdown('>*"Do not stop thinking of life as an adventure. You have no security unless you can live bravely, excitingly, imaginatively; unless you can choose a challenge instead of competence."* - Eleanor Roosevelt')
        st.markdown("""[Eleanor Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Roosevelt) (October 11, 1884 - November 7, 1962) was an American 
        political figure, diplomat, and activist. She served as the first lady of the United States from 1933 to 1945, during her husband 
        President Franklin D. Roosevelt's four terms in office, making her the longest-serving first lady of the United States.
        Roosevelt served as United States Delegate to the United Nations General Assembly from 1945 to 1952.
        President Harry S. Truman later called her the "First Lady of the World" in tribute to her human rights achievements. 
        Roosevelt was a member of the prominent American Roosevelt and Livingston families and a niece of President Theodore Roosevelt.
        She had an unhappy childhood, having suffered the deaths of both parents and one of her brothers at a young age. 
        At 15, she attended Allenswood Boarding Academy in London and was deeply influenced by its headmistress Marie Souvestre. 
        Returning to the U.S., she married her fifth cousin once removed, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in 1905. 
        The Roosevelts' marriage was complicated from the beginning by Franklin's controlling mother, Sara, and after 
        Eleanor discovered her husband's affair with Lucy Mercer in 1918, she resolved to seek fulfillment in leading a public life of her own. 
        She persuaded Franklin to stay in politics after he was stricken with a paralytic illness in 1921, which cost him the normal use of his legs, 
        and began giving speeches and appearing at campaign events in his place. 
        Following Franklin's election as Governor of New York in 1928, and throughout the remainder of Franklin's public career in government, 
        Roosevelt regularly made public appearances on his behalf; and as First Lady, while her husband served as president, she significantly 
        reshaped and redefined the role. Though widely respected in her later years, Roosevelt was a controversial first lady at the time 
        for her outspokenness, particularly on civil rights for African-Americans. She was the first presidential spouse to hold regular 
        press conferences, write a daily newspaper column, write a monthly magazine column, host a weekly radio show, 
        and speak at a national party convention. On a few occasions, she publicly disagreed with her husband's policies. 
        She launched an experimental community at Arthurdale, West Virginia, for the families of unemployed miners, later widely regarded 
        as a failure. She advocated for expanded roles for women in the workplace, the civil rights of African Americans and Asian Americans, 
        and the rights of World War II refugees. Following her husband's death in 1945, Roosevelt remained active in politics for the 
        remaining 17 years of her life. She pressed the United States to join and support the United Nations and became its first delegate. 
        She served as the first chair of the UN Commission on Human Rights and oversaw the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
        Later, she chaired the John F. Kennedy administration's Presidential Commission on the Status of Women. 
        By the time of her death, Roosevelt was regarded as "one of the most esteemed women in the world"; 
        The New York Times called her "the object of almost universal respect" in her obituary.
        In 1999, she was ranked ninth in the top ten of Gallup's List of Most Widely Admired People of the 20th Century, 
        and was listed thirteen times as the most admired woman between 1948 and 1961. """)
